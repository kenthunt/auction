There are very few works towards formalizing financial markets. Passmore et al. in \cite{Passmore} highlights the significance, opportunities and challanges involved in formalizing financial markets. This work describes in great detail the whole spectrum of the financial algorithms to be verified for ensuring safe and fair markets. Matching algorithms used by exchanges are at the core of this whole spectrum. However, there are no work known to us which formalizes financial algorithms used by the exchanges.

On the other hand there are quite a few works \cite{toolbox} formalizing variuos concepts from auction theory. Most of these works focus on the Vickrey auction mechanism. In Vickrey auction, there is a single seller with different items and multiple buyers with valuations for every subsets of items. Each buyer places bids for combinations of the items. At the end of the bidding, the seller devides the items to buyers. The aim if the seller is to compute a partition of the items which maximizes his profit.
